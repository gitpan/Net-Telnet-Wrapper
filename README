SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Telnet::Wrapper;

    ## connect to Cisco router and execute show version + show clock
    my $w = Net::Telnet::Wrapper->new('device_class' => 'Cisco::IOS', -host => 'routerA');
    eval {
    	$w->login( 'name' => "mwallraf", 'passwd' => "<mypass>", 'Passcode' => "<mypass>");
    	$w->enable( 'name' => "mwallraf", 'passwd' => "<mypass>", 'Passcode' => "<mypass>");

    my $w = Net::Telnet::Wrapper->new('device_class' => 'TCP::HTTP', -host => 'www.google.com');
    eval {
    #	print $w->cmd("GET /index.html HTTP/1.0\n\n");

DESCRIPTION

A wrapper or extension for Net::Telnet and Net::Telnet::Cisco that adds some
default procedures like multiple login attempts as well as output formatting, error checking etc.

The wrapper has templates or device classes defined for many devices like Cisco routers, switches, 
firewalls but also Nortel, Packeteer, Unix etc.  
It's possible to add templates for almost any application that listens on a TCP port.
All templates can be found in the Device folder.

Net::Telnet::Wrapper is not a replacement for Net::Telnet(::Cisco) and has to be used exactly
the same way with the same parameters etc. It does have a few additional parameters and procedures.
